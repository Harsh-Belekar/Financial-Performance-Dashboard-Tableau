## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Data cleaning was performed using **Python in Jupyter Notebook** to ensure high-quality, analysis-ready data.

### Key Cleaning Steps:

* Removed currency symbols (`$`) and commas from numeric fields
* Converted financial columns to numeric data types
* Handled missing and invalid values
* Standardized column names for Tableau compatibility
* Converted date fields to proper datetime format
* Validated financial logic (Sales, COGS, Discounts, Profit)

📘 *Notebook:* `notebook/Financial_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`
